# MCP Server Setup (Remote) - Linux

## Background
Tally Prime does not run natively on linux-based OS. Tally is available only for Windows Desktop &amp; Windows Server editions. But when it comes to web-server, Linux-based OS is the preferred choice over Windows Server OS. Linux-based Server OS is secure &amp; faster compared to Windows. This makes it better choice for running MCP server.

## Pre-requisites
Before proceeding with setup, below are few things an organization needs to have:
* Domain
* SSL Certificate
* Ubuntu Server 20 (or higher)
* Tally Prime (Silver / Gold)

Note: Kindly avoid using Educational version of Tally Prime, which has limitations of date range. It will result in invalid / partial data being fed to LLM, leading to highly degraded &amp; incorrect responses.

Also, person configuring server must have technical knowledge &amp; experience of below things:
* Hands-on experience of linux commands
* Configuration of web-server like Nginx / Apache, setting up websites
* Installation of Node JS via package manager
* Basic knowledge of running Tally Prime in Windows Server

## Architecture

## SSH Tunnel
MCP Server needs to communicate with Tally Prime. Running tally in linux is not a viable solution. SSH (Secured Shell Host) supports forwarding Tally Prime XML server listening on port 9000 to the linux server, via remote port forwarding.

Ensure that XML port of Tally Prime is enabled and listening on port 9000 (already explained in home page documentation). Latest version of PowerShell / Windows Terminal, is already shipped with SSH. Alternatively one can use popular Graphical softwares like Putty, Terminus, etc which supports SSH. From the Windows PC / Server, enter below command to forward port to linux server

```bash
ssh -R 9000:localhost:9000 username@linux_server_host
```

This would initiate SSH session with the said port of Tally Prime made available to linux system for communication with Tally. Test if Tally Prime is responding by entering below command in linux terminal

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000
```

This should display below text in the terminal

```xml
<RESPONSE>TallyPrime Server is Running</RESPONSE>
```

Below care needs to be taken:
1. Internet connectivity needs to be stable, as SSH is not designed to re-connect automatically if connectivity drops. Kindly use professional softwares like [Bitvise SSH Client](https://bitvise.com/ssh-client) which support auto-reconnect.
1. Tally Prime must be running with single instance, without any manual intervention by any of the staff. Closing Tally, opening another instance of Tally, changing the company in Tally will hamper connectivity. Kindly prefer using Windows Server with a dedicated standard user account which usually office staff does not login.

## Ubuntu Setup
Tally MCP Server is powered by Node JS, and runs as a web-server. Unfortunately, Node JS powered web-server are not a good choice for front facing web-server. So, popular web-server for linux like Apache, Nginx are required to act as front facing web-server, which have hardened security. Node JS based MCP server will act as back facing web-server which is protected from outside world. Using reverse proxy feature, apache / nginx can forward requests to back facing MCP server.

### Nginx
Below is the sample configuration for Nginx which has been tested. Kindly substitute **example.com** with respective domain name. Also ensure to point SSL certificate &amp; private key with respective path (or location).

```
# /etc/nginx/conf.d/example_com.conf

# HTTP handler for redirection to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    rewrite ^/(.*) https://example.com/$1 permanent;
}

# HTTPS handler (reverse proxy)
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /path_of_ssl_certificate/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path_of_ssl_private_key/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers         'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';

    location / {

    proxy_set_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://example.com';
    proxy_set_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';
    proxy_set_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Authorization,Accept,Origin,X-CustomHeader,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Content-Range,Range,mcp-session-id';
    proxy_set_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET,POST,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE,PATCH';

    if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://example.com';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Authorization,Accept,Origin,DNT,X-CustomHeader,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Content-Range,Range,mcp-session-id';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET,POST,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE,PATCH';
        add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 1728000;
        add_header 'Content-Type' 'text/plain charset=UTF-8';
        add_header 'Content-Length' 0;
        return 204;
    }

    proxy_redirect off;

    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### NodeJS Tally MCP Server
Tally MCP server can be accessed by anyone publicly over the web, it is protected by OAuth 2.0 authentication as specified in MCP server development documentation. Kindly generate alpha-numeric password of minimum 8 characters (use random string generator websites). Download &amp; extract zip archive from the download link (available on home page documentation).

Assuming password is **8LszTe5T** , domain is **example.com** and mcp server is extracted in location **/home/user/tally_mcp_server** , cd into the location, and edit file .env with below config

```
PASSWORD=8LszTe5T
MCP_DOMAIN=https://example.com
CONNECTION_STRING=
```

run mcp server with below command from bash terminal

```bash
node dist/server.mjs
```

This will start back facing Tally MCP Server, which receives request from front facing Nginx and communicate to Tally Prime via SSH tunnel. Manually running above command from linux terminal should be used only for testing purpose. On closing of linux terminal, MCP server launched by above command will be stopped. Kindly use process manager like [PM2 for Node JS](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep MCP server running.
